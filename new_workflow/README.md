The Adsorbate, Adsorbates, and AdsorbatesEnsemble classes contain methods to compute temperature dependant entropy, heat capacty, and standard state enthalpy of formation from statistical mechanics, as well as methods which fit NASA7 polynomials to these thermodynamic quantities, and plot a comparison between the NASA7 polynomial and the values from statisical mechanics. These classes also then have the functionality of writing RMG thermo database entries, or entire files, or even ensembles of files. The class Adsorbate is designed to handle a single adsorbate, where Adsorbates is designed to handle a list of adsorbates, and AdsorbatesEnsemble hanldes a list of adsorbates with the addition of an ensemble of energies for the adsorbates and reference species.

For all of these classes a similar set of inputs are required. You will need to create a file for the dft data on your adsorbate, or list of adsorbates. You will need to create a file that stores information about your reference species, and a third file which contains information about your surface. Please see the [examples](https://github.com/kirkbadger18/thermo_kinetics_scripts/tree/new_workflow/new_workflow/examples) which show how to do this.
